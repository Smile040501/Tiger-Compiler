# Using the Compiler

Once the installation is complete, the `tc` executable will be generated which is the final tiger compiler executable in the root directory of the project.\
You may run the compiler on an input tiger source file as follows to get the MIPS assembly code.

```bash
./tc [OPTIONS] program.tig
```

## Available Options

```
-?
--help
    Display the help message.

-A
--ast
    Display the AST generated from the source file.

-D
--debug
   Display all the required information for debugging.

-F
--file
    Execute the source tiger file. This is the default.

-I
--ir
    Display the IR generated from the source file.

-R
--reg-alloc
    Display the register allocation performed by the compiler.

-T
--temp-alloc
    Display the temporaries allocation performed by the compiler.

-S
--asm
    Display the final assembler code.
```

# Using the Makefile

`$ make all`

Makes the tiger compiler executable named `tc` in the root directory of the project.

`$ make log`

List all the files on which the compiler depends.

`$ make run [TF=tests/custom.tig]`

Executes the Tiger binary for the file with default **tests/custom.tig** in debug mode and also execute the SPIM simulator for the generated assembly code.

`$ make tc{n}`

Executes the test case **test{n}.tig** in the tests directory.

`$ make tests`

Execute all the test cases listed in **tests** dir. Make sure to have both **file.tig** and **file.out** files present containing input and output respectively.

`$ make clean`

Cleans the new files generated by the compiler. This also includes the tiger compiler executable.
